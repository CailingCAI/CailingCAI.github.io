I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Digital Innovation and Technology at The Hong Kong Institute of Higher Education (THEi). I hold a Ph.D. in Computer Science from The University of Hong Kong, and my academic journey began with a B.Sc. in Mathematics and Statistics from Huizhou University, followed by an M.Sc. in Mathematics and Information Science from Guangzhou University.

My research interests lie at the intersection of cryptography, data privacy, AI security, blockchain security, and post-quantum cryptography. I focus on designing privacy-preserving solutions for next-generation digital systems, including secure communication frameworks for large language models, trusted data exchange protocols, and secure decentralized applications.

In addition to my academic work, I have over two years of industry experience as a senior engineer and postdoctoral researcher, where I contributed to multiple R&D projects on secure systems, privacy-enhancing technologies, and cryptographic protocols.

I am passionate about building secure and privacy-aware technologies that empower trust in the digital age.
